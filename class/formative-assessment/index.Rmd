## Question 1

```{r question_1}
question(
  "1) Your dataset has a string column with dates like `\"16 de dezembro de 2022\"` and you want to parse it to Date with the `lubridate` package. Which steps you need to take?",
    answer(
      "extract components, use lubridate functions", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "no, extract components is another"
      ),
    answer(
      "use lubridate, then correct order", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "no, you can get a result, but you won't know if it's correct once you didn't identify the correct date elements order"
      ),
    answer(
      "use as.date, then parse with lubridate", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "no, lubridate replaces as.Date base R functions for converting strings to Date elements"
      ),
    answer(
      "identify order, use lubridate",
      correct = TRUE
      ),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = "that's correct, once ou identify the order (in that case, date, month and year) you can use the currect lubridate function for it."
)
```

## Question 2

```{r question_2}
question(
  "2) You have a date string that's \"2011-08-12\", what's the lubridate function to parse it and expected format?",
    answer(
      "lubridate::ymd -> \"2011-08-12\"", 
      correct = TRUE,
      ),
    answer(
      "lubridate::ydm -> \"2011-12-08\"", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "no, you can get a result, but you won't know if it's correct once you didn't identify the correct date elements order"
      ),
    answer(
      "as.Date -> \"2011-08-12\"", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "correct output, but function not from lubridate"
      ),
    answer(
      "lubridate::ymd_hms",
      correct = FALSE,
      "no hms info, so it's going to fail"
      ),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = "that's correct, the order is YYYY MM DD"
)
```

## Question 3

```{r question_3}
question(
  "3) Have a date and time element and want to extract day of month",
    answer(
      "as.Date", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "already a date, doesn't need to convert"
      ),
    answer(
      "lubridate::day", 
      correct = TRUE,
      ),
    answer(
      "lubridate::wday", 
      correct = FALSE,
      message = "no, weekday"
      ),
    answer(
      "lubridate::date",
      correct = FALSE,
      "no, whole date"
      ),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = "that's correct, the day function extracts day"
)
```
